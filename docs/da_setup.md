The `setup.py` script verifies and installs the dependencies of the `accelerate_workbooks.py` script. The script will require internet connectivity to download the libraries if they are not already installed.

Check that you are using Python 2.7.9 or later or Python 3.5 or later by typing `python --version`.

To run the script on Windows type, `setup.py` or to run the script on Linux, type `sudo setup.py`.
